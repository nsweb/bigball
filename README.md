Basic opengl engine, that serves the purposes of my other pet projects.
Originally 'forked' from the lol engine (http://lolengine.net/) a while ago, and adapted to fit my needs.

This engine provides basic functionalities, and is in perpertual work-in-progress, I would not consider using it for a serious project.
